# Using React instead of Vue

To use React to build JavaScript applications, Laravel makes it a cinch to swap the Vue scaffolding with React scaffolding.
On any fresh Laravel application, you may use the preset command with the react option:


```console
php artisan preset react
```

##### This single command will remove the Vue scaffolding and replace it with React scaffolding, including an example component.
